			b Democracy at Work - Los Angeles (D@W-LA)
			|, we endeavor to further our parent organizationâ€™s purpose, that is, raising awareness and generating a positive cultural shift towards Worker Self-Directed Enterprises. WSDEs are a way to reorganize our workplaces in a truly democratic fashion, where decision-making power and wealth are shared equally. Through promotion, education, and connection with local organizations, we aim to be a hub in Los Angeles that advocates for and facilitates the transformation of our economic system.
